# Consumer Complaints Analysis

## Description

This Python project analyzes consumer complaints data downloaded from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) website. It performs various data analysis tasks such as exploring the distribution of complaints over time, identifying the most common types of complaints, analyzing resolution times for different types of complaints, and converting JSON data to CSV format.

## Files

- `consumer_complaints_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis tasks.
- `complaints.csv`: Consumer complaints data downloaded from the CFPB website.
- `sample_json.json`: Sample JSON file containing servlet information.

## Dependencies

- pandas: Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Python library used for numerical computations.
- matplotlib: Python library used for data visualization.
- json: Python library used for working with JSON data.

## Tasks

1. **Distribution of Complaints Over Time**:
   - Analyze the distribution of complaints over time.
   - Explore trends and patterns in the data.
   
2. **Identifying the Most Common Complaint Types**:
   - Identify the most common types of complaints.
   - Visualize the frequency of complaint types.

3. **Analysis of Resolution Time for Different Complaint Types**:
   - Analyze the resolution time for different types of complaints.
   - Visualize the distribution of resolution times.

4. **Conversion of JSON to CSV**:
   - Extract "servlet-name" and "servlet-class" from the provided JSON data.
   - Convert the data into CSV format and save it.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open `consumer_complaints_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and perform the analysis.
5. Make sure to have `complaints.csv` and `sample_json.json` files in the same directory as the notebook.
